This is the Geofancy for Android app. I've started Geofancy as a side project at the begining of 2013, the iOS has well evolved since then, sadly I've never really had time to work on the Android app.

I'm releasing this project as open source now, maybe someone can benefit from it, it's building fine using a current version of Android Studio (at the time being) but there's some NPEs when trying to add Geofences, probably because of some old Gmaps APIs? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

However, just fork this repo, fix it and create a PR (troll). Or take it yourself and build something (awesome) with it. I don't mind, it's up to you.

Here's a screenshot from the iOS version (at the time of writing this):

The Android app is pretty much feature complete, but definitelty needs to be modernized before it can be used standalone or even with the [https://my.geofancy.com](https://my.geofancy.com) backend.
